**Title: [Showcase] BoondManager MCP Server v1.0.0 - 121 Tools for Business Automation**

Hey everyone!

I've just released the stable v1.0.0 of the **BoondManager MCP Server**. It's a TypeScript-based implementation of the Model Context Protocol that gives AI assistants (like Claude) full access to the BoondManager API.

**What's inside?**

- **121 Tools**: Full CRUD operations across 8 domains (HR, CRM, Finance, Projects, Time, Admin, Documents, System).
- **Production Ready**: 189/189 tests passing, fully type-safe with Zod validation.
- **LTS Commitment**: 3 years of support (12mo active + 24mo maintenance).
- **Easy Setup**: Works out of the box with Claude Desktop.

**Why use it?**
Instead of switching tabs, you can just ask Claude to "Find candidates with React experience in Paris" or "Create a time report for today". It brings your business data directly into your AI workflow.

**Check it out on GitHub:**

Feedback and contributions are very welcome!
